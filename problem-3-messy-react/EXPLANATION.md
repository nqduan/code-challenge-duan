# âœ… Problem 3: Messy React â€“ Refactor & Explanation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This task demonstrates how I identified inefficiencies in a messy React + TypeScript component, explained the anti-patterns, and refactored it to follow modern best practices.

---

## âœ… 1. Issues in the Original Version

### ðŸš© 1) `getPriority` declared inside the component

- It was re-created on every render, causing unnecessary re-computation.

---

### ðŸš© 2) Weak or missing type safety

- The `blockchain` parameter used `any` âžœ no type checking.
- `WalletBalance` was declared in multiple places âžœ risk of inconsistent types.

---

### ðŸš© 3) Wrong variable in filter

- The filter logic used an undefined variable `lhsPriority` instead of `balancePriority`.

---

### ðŸš© 4) Confusing filter logic

- It kept balances with `amount <= 0` instead of filtering them out âžœ unclear intention.

---

### ðŸš© 5) Redundant `formattedBalances`

- An extra mapped array was generated but never actually used âžœ wasted code.

---

### ðŸš© 6) Bad `useMemo` dependency

- The memoization depended on `prices` even though they were not used in the filtering or sorting âžœ causes unnecessary recalculations.

---

### ðŸš© 7) Using `key={index}`

- Using array index as a key in `.map` is an anti-pattern âžœ can break rendering if the list order changes.

---

### ðŸš© 8) Unnecessary `BoxProps` and empty `Props`

- The original `Props` extended `BoxProps` from MUI but the component used a plain `<div>` âžœ extra dependency for no reason.
- The `Props` interface was otherwise empty âžœ redundant.

---

## âœ… 2. How I Improved It

### âœ¨ 1) Moved `getPriority` outside the component

- This avoids re-creating the function every render âžœ more efficient.

---

### âœ¨ 2) Stronger typing for `blockchain`

- Explicitly typed `blockchain` as `string` instead of `any` âžœ safer.

---

### âœ¨ 3) Centralized `WalletBalance` type

- Declared `WalletBalance` in `types/wallet.ts` and imported it âžœ reuse across hooks and components âžœ consistent and DRY.

---

### âœ¨ 4) Filter logic simplified

- Clear, simple condition:
  ```ts
  return priority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;
  ```

### âœ¨ 5) Removed unused formattedBalances

- No extra arrays âžœ formatting handled directly when rendering rows.

### âœ¨ 6) Corrected useMemo dependencies

- Now depends only on balances âžœ prices only used when rendering.

### âœ¨ 7) Used stable unique key

- Replaced key={index} with key={balance.currency} âžœ stable and safe for React reconciliation.

### âœ¨ 8) Removed BoxProps and empty Props

- Now the component uses plain HTML elements âžœ no MUI dependency âžœ simpler and lighter.

### âœ¨ 9) Better folder structure

- Added a types/ folder for shared types.

- Hooks and components all reuse the same types âžœ better maintainability.
